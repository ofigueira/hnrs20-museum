						<h2>Haven</h2>
						<p>A haven is a safe place, a place where one feels at home. It is not so much a place, but rather a feeling. Haven is about spending time with the people you love, and the memories that you make together. Many of these objects bring forth nostalgic feelings, bringing comfort to people in a time when the past is perhaps happier than their present. The idea of haven elicits memories of childhood and of simpler times, where love was freely given and time was of no concern.</p>

						<h3>Stuffed Animal</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/stuffed-animal.jpg" alt="Stuffed animal" style="height: 500px; width: 400px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>The stuffed toy in this image is Roo, a character from the children’s book Winnie-the-Pooh. Stuffed toys, such as Roo, are sewn with an outer fabric from a textile and stuffed with flexible material. They often come in the form of animals, hence the more commonly used term –– stuffed animal. Stuffed animals originated in Germany in the late 19th century and have enjoyed increasing popularity over the decades. They are most often given to children as a source of comfort or companionship. Many times, children will keep their favorite stuffed “friends” into adulthood as a reminder of childhood. Roo, for example, is happily sitting on my bed in my college dorm room.</p>
								<p>Funnily enough, I did not actually get Roo as a young child. I picked him out as a souvenir on a high school choir trip to Disneyland. Even though he is not a beloved stuffed animal from childhood, he serves as a happy reminder of simpler times. His blue shirt also matches my room, so that’s an added bonus!	</p>

						<h3>Dog Collar</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>It’s hard to explain how magical a relationship with a dog is, but if I had to say it would be dogs' special capacity for love. They are creatures that truly love you, that think of you as a member of their family. They will fight, protect, and die for their owners. They will live in horrible conditions and face any danger. And they do it all out of a pure, unyielding sense of love.</p>
								<p>My dog brings so much joy into my life. It is impossible for me to be sad when I’m with my dog because simply looking at my dog makes me happy. It doesn’t matter what bad experience I’m going through, being with my dog makes it better. It’s as if all my problems disappear and are replaced with joy. Dogs are also extremely useful. Dogs can be trained to do so many things. They can be trained as guide dogs for the blind, to herd sheep or other farm animals, to sniff out drugs, to chase and capture criminals, and more.</p>

						<h3>Christmas Lights</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/christmas-lights1.jpg" alt="Christmas lights" style="height: 500px; width: 400px;"/></a>
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>These multi-colored electrical lights are used for decoration during the holiday season (typically late November to early January). Christmas lights emerged from an earlier Christian tradition of decorating Christmas trees with candles, symbolizing the light of Christ. Although, this custom was borrowed from pagan rituals that celebrated the return of light after solstice. Christians began claiming this tradition in the early modern period of Germany (1500-1800). Since then, candles and other forms of light have become a popular symbol of Christmas.</p>
								<p>In the mid-twentieth century,  Christmas lights transitioned beyond the Christmas tree. Electrical lighting became a popular choice to illuminate buildings, rooftops, windows (as pictured here), and various other spaces. These are the lights that evoke warm memories of my childhood and hold a special place in my heart. Growing up, my family never failed to miss a year of putting up Christmas lights and many of our neighbors also held this tradition. One of the happiest memories of my childhood is driving through my neighborhood in December, listening to Dean Martin Christmas music, and admiring the twinkling lights.</p>

						<h3>Reindeer Antlers</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>Something I think that would be interesting to observe in a post-apocalyptic world would be seeing what kind of traditions survive. Today, it is almost impossible to miss holiday celebrations with the amount of marketing that is done in our capitalistic society. These reindeer antlers are a representation of one of the most celebrated holidays in the West, Christmas. I have worn this to many a holiday party and use them as a festive accessory.</p>
								<p>Each December, Christmas is a ubiquitous concept, with Christmas music playing in all public spaces, holiday flavored drinks at every coffee shop, and advertisements online and in person that pressure people to buy, buy, buy. However, after the world ends there is no more money, so what kind of meaning would Christmas take on without the pressure of consumption? What would Christmas look like without mass produced gimmicks? Would people learn to celebrate in more genuine ways, or will holidays like this cease to be celebrated widely without a strong culture to promote it? Something I think I would miss is how quickly something as simple and silly as a pair of reindeer antlers could lift someone's spirits. In a world void of department stores and mass produced goods, one would have to think much deeper about what constitutes a gift and what true holiday traditions are about.</p>

						<h3>Holiday Decorations</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/holiday-decorations.jpeg" alt="Holiday decorations" style="height: 500px; width: 650px;"/></a>
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>Decorating homes and businesses with lights, trees, and snow is done internationality. Marking the holidays, putting up holiday lights in preparation for and to celebrate the holidays has no utility or tangible return; I do it because it makes me happy. These decorations are done at both small and large scales, with people declaring every inch of their house’s exterior in lights, reindeer, snow-people, trees, and snowflakes, in addition to having a tree inside their home adorned with lights, ornaments, both traditional bulbs and fun items that remind us of each other or places we’ve been. For me, I always put up my family’s Christmas tree and lights with my dad after Thanksgiving, and it’s a tradition that I will cherish forever.</p>
								<p>Decorating for the holidays is something I do purely for my enjoyment, and it’s so fun to see decorations that I travel to different places just to see massive displays during the holidays! In this image, I visited a stadium in Seattle that was entirely decorated with holiday lights, complete with an ice skating rink and maze within the lights themselves. This moment was special to me because I came here with my boyfriend, who is absolutely obsessed with Christmas, and this experience made the holidays so much more joyful.</p>

						<h3>Root Beer Floats</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>Ah, the ingeniously simple combination of root beer, vanilla ice cream, and love. It is a concoction so glorious, so heavenly, that it should never be forgotten or forgone.</p>
								<p>In this beverage lies my most vivid, happy childhood memory. A root beer float reminds me of father-daughter trips to Winsteads, a Kansas City diner chain that is practically a relic itself (the closed establishments scatter the city: abandoned and dark, but familiar. No one dares to tear them down, even now). It reminds me of the drives home in my father’s 1999 Toyota Landcruiser, windows down, sunroof open, ABBA’s “Dancing Queen” flowing out of the stereo, swirling around then out with the wind, my hair sticking to my sugar-coated lips as I squeal the words between sips. Root beer floats remind me of the victories, as my father made them occasionally when something called for celebration. They remind of the times later in life when I hit rough bumps or came under a more stressful spell; each time, a homemade root beer float sits me back down in my worn-in leather seat in the Landcruiser. They continue to bring me peace, hope, and moments of serenity when I need them most desperately (I told you they were incredible). Some swear by meditation, some by exercise, some by warm baths– I swear by the power of The Root Beer Float.</p>

						<h3>Carbonated Drinks</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/Carbonation.jpeg" alt="La Croix can" style="height: 450px; width: 300px;"/></a>
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>Beer. Coke. Pepsi. Kombucha. Sparkling water. Red Bull. More than likely, I've named at least one beverage that you enjoy. It's hard to grasp just how much carbonated beverages have infiltrated our lives. As I write this, I'm sipping on a delicious Cerise Limón flavored La Croix. These drinks have been shot through with the gas carbon dioxide, which makes them bubbly when they are first opened. They're popular, and with good reason; the carbon dioxide adds texture, flavor, and (dare I say it?) excitement. However, the process of carbonation is extremely involved and requires finely-tuned, advanced machinery. Without modern technology, it would be almost impossible to experience the joy of fizz.</p>
