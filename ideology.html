						<h2>Ideology</h2>
						<p>Ideology is an inalienable part of mankind. Whether a person is religious, spiritual, atheist, agnostic, or anything in between, that ideology means something to them. For many people, their ideology serves as the basis for the moral code by which they live their life. Inseparable from who we are as people, our guiding principles influence almost every decision we make. If these things were taken away from people, they would be robbed of things that they use as their guiding light.</p>

						<h3>Cross Necklace</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/cross.jpg" alt="Cross necklace" style="height: 500px; width: 300px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>This artifact is a cross necklace. Often when things look bad, people turn to their religion to seek comfort or ask for guidance. A cross is a symbol of that faith for many people. It could help people have more hope in what their future holds in store, and it could help people see a greater purpose in their life. Also, while crosses are traditionally Christian symbols, they can also remind non-Christian people of their faith. Some people may be disheartened by their faith because of what led the world to collapse, but others may grow to be even more in touch with their faith, and this cross would help them see that through.</p>
								<p>I personally am not extremely religious, but I always feel more spiritual when I go to a place where I am somewhat disconnected from society. I got this cross from a retreat that was very impactful on who I am today, so it carries extra meaning for me. On retreats or when I’m camping in nature, I’m able to be more focused in the moment rather than concerned about the news or whatever I’m missing out on. As a result, I become much more open to my faith. I think that if I had this cross in the future with me, I would use it much more than I currently do, and I could use it to turn a tough situation into a more fulfilling one through faith.</p>

						<h3>The Constitution </h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>The Constitution of the United States of America establishes all governmental power in the United States. The Constitution was written in 1787 at the Philadelphia Convention. It was signed by some of the most influential men who formed the United States into what it is today. This includes: James Madison who contributed many of the ideas behind the significant document along with Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington. To me, this handwritten document stands as a symbol for the power that a group of individuals have when they come together around a central belief. I believe the document established a new governmental system that changed the way nations established and separated power.</p>
								<p>The US Constitution divides power into three branches and instituted a series of checks and balances that allowed for a new country to grow and foster. The document displays what people wanted from their government. Although the system is not perfect it allows for decisions to be made by the masses and allows for every citizen’s voice to be heard.</p>
								<p>The Bill of Rights displays the changes that are necessary over time. The first 10 Amendments to the constitution are written in the Bill of Rights. It is vital for a country to be able to adapt laws country as needed. Together these documents exhibit the human power of coming together and forming a strong central government that can represent all the people in a nation.</p>

						<h3>Bible</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/bible2.jpg" alt="Bible" style="height: 450px; width: 550px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>My faith is the most important thing I have, and my Bible is physical manifestation of it. I have had this Bible for almost a decade, and it is highlighted and marked up to denote the words that have given me strength and assurance in different times of my life. If the world as we know it were to end, I would have to learn how to rely on God in a completely new way. I would want this Bible to show the generations after me that organized religion was something that was important to people in today’s age, as I feel that the concept of a unifying belief system would be difficult to conceptualize after the fall of civilization.</p>
								<p>I also wonder what would happen to churches. If 99% of the population is wiped out, then what would happen to the concept of a gathering of believers? As well, what would happen to people who believe in Christianity? Would this sort of event cause people to increase their reliance on God or completely shatter their beliefs? Would it lead to an increase in the authenticity of believers or would it lead to extremism?</p>
