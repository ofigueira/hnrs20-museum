						<h2>Knowledge & Art</h2>
						<p>Art is one of the defining elements of the human experience. We spend years in school learning about great books and artwork throughout history. We peruse museums and chapels in ancient cities. We read, and write, and sketch, and go to the movies with our loved ones. Art is all around us, as is the knowledge we gain from it. Without things like books and sculptures, we would lose so much of our history; that is perhaps why this is the largest section of our museum. Art and education permeate so many aspects of our everyday lives that it seems nearly impossible to part with them.</p>

						<h3>Fahrenheit 451</h3>
						<div class="items">

							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>This artifact is a dystopian novel set in a future where books are outlawed and people spend all their time consuming other media. The novel looks at a society that is on the brink of destruction, and it makes the reader appreciate the real moments in life where you are present in “the now” rather than distracted by the flashing lights of society. This book is worth bringing into the future because it would help survivors appreciate life a little bit more since they wouldn’t have technology or superficiality to distract them. Also, books are another part of human history that have been timeless. While a good story teaches you a few things, it also allows you to escape your world and immerse yourself in a new one.</p>
								<p>This is one of my favorite books, and I personally think it would be cool to read it in a dystopian future to compare a reality that was dreamt up long ago to what happened in actuality. Also, this book kind of represents all books because the characters each try to memorize a book in the end. They each became an embodiment of a book, so that if the books were destroyed physically, their content would be remembered. The people in the future could be act similarly and pick a part of human history to make sure we don’t forget.</p>

						<h3>Guitar</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>This artifact is a musical instrument used to entertain, connect with others, or relax. Music is an important part of human history, and while it isn’t necessary for survival, it makes life much more enjoyable. Music can give us a break from the stresses of life, and a guitar enables any group to do that pretty easily. A guitarist can lead a group in singing a song together to bring everyone closer, or if they are really talented, they can be a real pleasure to listen to. That is why this instrument would be so valuable to bring into the future.</p>
								<p>I personally listen to music a lot, and while I don’t play my guitar much anymore, I would like to have a way to recreate the music I love in a future without streaming music. I could even express myself through my own songs.I think most people can relate to loving music, and it would make everyone a little bit happier to have some tunes to listen to. Whenever I go backpacking and find myself just surviving and enjoying nature, I always wish that I had music to listen to. Therefore preserving this guitar would enable me to scratch that itch.</p>
