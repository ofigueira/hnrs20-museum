						<h2>Knowledge & Art</h2>
						<p>Art is one of the defining elements of the human experience. We spend years in school learning about great books and artwork throughout history. We peruse museums and chapels in ancient cities. We read, and write, and sketch, and go to the movies with our loved ones. Art is all around us, as is the knowledge we gain from it. Without things like books and sculptures, we would lose so much of our history; that is perhaps why this is the largest section of our museum. Art and education permeate so many aspects of our everyday lives that it seems nearly impossible to part with them.</p>

						<h3>Fahrenheit 451</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/fahrenheit451.jpg" alt="Fahrenheit 451 book" style="height: 450px; width: 300px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>This artifact is a dystopian novel set in a future where books are outlawed and people spend all their time consuming other media. The novel looks at a society that is on the brink of destruction, and it makes the reader appreciate the real moments in life where you are present in “the now” rather than distracted by the flashing lights of society. This book is worth bringing into the future because it would help survivors appreciate life a little bit more since they wouldn’t have technology or superficiality to distract them. Also, books are another part of human history that have been timeless. While a good story teaches you a few things, it also allows you to escape your world and immerse yourself in a new one.</p>
								<p>This is one of my favorite books, and I personally think it would be cool to read it in a dystopian future to compare a reality that was dreamt up long ago to what happened in actuality. Also, this book kind of represents all books because the characters each try to memorize a book in the end. They each became an embodiment of a book, so that if the books were destroyed physically, their content would be remembered. The people in the future could be act similarly and pick a part of human history to make sure we don’t forget.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<h3>Guitar</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>This artifact is a musical instrument used to entertain, connect with others, or relax. Music is an important part of human history, and while it isn’t necessary for survival, it makes life much more enjoyable. Music can give us a break from the stresses of life, and a guitar enables any group to do that pretty easily. A guitarist can lead a group in singing a song together to bring everyone closer, or if they are really talented, they can be a real pleasure to listen to. That is why this instrument would be so valuable to bring into the future.</p>
								<p>I personally listen to music a lot, and while I don’t play my guitar much anymore, I would like to have a way to recreate the music I love in a future without streaming music. I could even express myself through my own songs.I think most people can relate to loving music, and it would make everyone a little bit happier to have some tunes to listen to. Whenever I go backpacking and find myself just surviving and enjoying nature, I always wish that I had music to listen to. Therefore preserving this guitar would enable me to scratch that itch.</p>

						<h3>Books</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/books.jpeg" alt="Books" style="height: 500px; width: 450px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>Books are some of the oldest and most important parts of human history. They are bound pieces of paper, printed with words and images. Their purpose is to tell a story or communicate information to a reader.</p>
								<p>For as long as I can remember, I have loved reading. I can’t fathom a part of my life where I wasn’t always actively reading at least one thing. To this day, I bring a book almost everywhere I go, no matter how inconvenient it is. They’ve gotten me through some tough times and followed me through some good ones. They inspired my love of writing, and (unsurprisingly) were the reason I declared an English major. For me, books are an escape from the chaos of the world around me, always there to turn to with no judgment or sour looks. Above, I assembled some of my absolute favorites that I genuinely think I would cry if I had to part with. They represent a diverse array of interests, from political rom-coms to ancient studies of virtue to nature encyclopedias. Every single book on my shelf has a piece of my soul, and to pick any of them up feels like coming home in a way I haven’t been able to replicate.</p>

						<h3>Camera</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>A camera is a device that uses a complex system of mirrors and digital computers to capture an image. They range in quality and ability, but all serve the same central purpose of preserving memories and images for a later date.</p>
								<p>I got a camera for my 15th birthday, and since then, it’s gone everywhere with me. I’ve photographed from the Grand Canyon to Yellowstone, Santa Cruz to New York City. Everything I find beautiful, or compelling, or even vaguely interesting, I attempt to photograph. To me, a camera is not only a way of capturing the beauty of the world around me, but also a vessel that holds memories of all sorts of adventures. Whether it’s photos of my friends and I in my backyard or the most beautiful landscapes in the world, my camera holds those memories so that I can always go back and appreciate them. Without it, a lot of those memories would start to fade.</p>

						<h3>Records</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/records.jpeg" alt="Records" style="height: 400px; width: 500px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>Records are vinyl discs imprinted with lines that, when a needle runs along them, create vibrations that turn into music when it comes through the speakers of the record player. They are used to house a variety of music types, and often play in the background of many homes.</p>
								<p>Music is a huge part of my life, and it has been for a long time. I was in musicals and choirs throughout my entire childhood, and my love of all things music has only strengthened as I’ve gotten older. To me, music is something that can make anything better. It can distract you from bad times, lift you up during good ones, and everything in between. I chose to display my Queen’s Greatest Hit Vol. I vinyl because Queen is my favorite band of all time. I have so many happy memories associated with their music, and it’s the first record I ever purchased (I’ve since acquired more). This record brings me so much joy every time I listen to it, and that experience is one I can’t recreate with anything else. If music were to become a thing of yesterday, I genuinely don’t know what I would do.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<h3>Camera</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>Cameras are electronic devices that use a lens to direct the light of what’s in front of it into a single point that can be captured. The captured light is then recorded transformed into an image. The image is a replica of the what was in front of the camera before the image was taken. The images are then able to be viewed on the digital screen of the camera or can be printed on paper to be recorded forever.</p>
								<p> In our current world cameras give us the ability to capture memories in the blink of an eye. They allow us to preserve the memories so we can reminisce about them later in life. The pictures taken by the cameras are an opportunity to transport people to happy memories of their childhood or to trips taken with friends. Periodically, I look back on my camera roll at all of the fun memories I had in high school. These memories fill me with joy and if they would disappear, I would feel like a part of my past would disappear with them. Without cameras, the memories still exist but would fade and start to disappear with time. Cameras keep the past alive and allow me to see historic pictures such a picture of my mom when she was a child.</p>

						<h3>Headphones</h3>

							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>Headphones are amazing. They’re electronic devices that produce sound and are worn around the ear. They can be made to replicate any sound there is, any piece of music, bird call, actor’s voice. My preferred use for headphones is to listen to music. There’s no need to go see a band play music, when my headphones replicate their songs. I find listening to music very calming. Whenever I’m stressed or have anxiety, listening to music usually puts me in a good mood. Headphones are also helpful when having a hard time falling asleep. Playing the soothing sounds of waves crashing on a beach can put me to sleep in a couple of minutes.  Headphones have an amazing ability to block out the rest of the world. I could be sitting on a bench waiting for the bus; the honking of cars and talking of people surrounding me. But they all go away when I put on my headphones. I’m transported to anywhere I want to be; a Mozart concert, the beach, next to a crackling fire. Everything around me is consumed by whatever sound I desire. I couldn’t imagine a world without my headphones.</p>

						<h3>Headphones</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>PowerBeats Pro wireless earbuds provide me with freedom to listen to music whenever and wherever. Approximately two inches by two inches, the earbuds can easily be fit in a pocket for max portability. The earbuds are produced in a multitude of colors. They are water resistant, adjustable, and can be used for up to nine hours before needing a charge.</p>
								<p>The tool used to access infinite collections of music and allow the listener to experience more than just the world around them. Earbuds are a connection to the exploration of the sense of sound. These earbuds are my connection to the musical artist. In a world where there are so many industrial sounds and man made commotion, earbuds provide me with a quiet environment and focus.</p>

						<h3>Hamilton Screenplay</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit" class = "item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/hamilton.png" alt="" style="height: 350px; width: 500px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>The musical “Hamilton” was one of the most influential pieces of media in the 21st century. To me, the creativity of humans is on full display in this musical. The script and score combine to tell the story of one of the founding fathers of the United States to the soundtrack of modern day hip-hop. This ingenious mix is able to tell a story vital to the country while appealing to younger generations today. This musical, entirely written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, altered the way the public perceived Broadway. The play also made a distinct effort to cast a diverse cast full of people of many different races, ethnicities, and backgrounds.</p>
								<p>This snapshot offers a view into American culture and the important changes being made. I believe the originality of the musical Hamilton changed Broadway. On a far greater scale it altered the view many Americans, including me, had of the figure Alexander Hamilton. Alexander Hamilton’s story from growing up as an orphan surviving financial hardship to becoming a foundational leader of a new country is very relatable to many Americans in the late 1700s and today. His handwork to become a self-reliant and respectable leader is truly the American dream on display.</p>

						<h3>Dictionary of Languages</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>Simply put, human beings are just another animal living on the planet earth.  I believe what has separated us from the animals around us and allowed us to grow into a dominant species is our ability to communicate with each other. We have formed a vast variety of languages and dialects which allow humans to express emotions, share ideas, and become more intelligent. Learning from each other has allowed humans the ability to adapt to our surroundings as the world around us has changed over time.</p>
								<p>Human beings have developed a multitude of languages all over the world. Presented here are dictionaries from a few of the most vital and influential dialects. A dictionary is a book filled with hundreds of thousands of words. Each word is written in its own individual way. The dictionary also describes the inflection and sound used to speak the word and has its own meaning. These unique aspects are all written out in a dictionary. Furthermore, I believe the dictionaries of other languages display the ingenuity and creativity used by human beings to create vastly different languages based on where a group of people lived on the Earth. Comparing the dictionaries allows for one to translate from one language to another. Thereby it would allow for me to communicate with anyone on this planet.</p>

						<h3>Guitar</h3>
						<div class="items">

							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>A guitar is a stringed musical instrument that evolved from earlier instruments like the lute and the mandolin. Guitar is one of the most popular and prevalent instruments of the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>
								<p>I chose this object because while the physical guitar itself holds special meaning to me, it also represents music and art in a larger sense. This guitar was my graduation gift from my father when I graduated high school. It’s a Martin Acoustic, and the Martin brand is known for its daft craftsmanship and woodworking. The guitar itself is a work of art, and was handmade. The guitar represents music, and performance, besides representing craftsmanship. I believe that art is something that needs to be preserved, and that a musical instrument is the perfect way to represent, not just current music, but the history of music itself. Guitar has been used in nearly every type of music, classical to cultural music, like spanish guitar, to pop music. Music is an important aspect of our culture. It is one of the most invasive art forms in modern society, and has been a landmark of human entertainment since the stone age.</p>

						<h3>Dictionary of Idioms</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>Dictionaries are catalogs of words, or in this case, phrases along with their meanings. This was a book that I loved in my childhood. I would sit around and just read through idioms, their meaning, and their origin. I learned a lot of common sayings from this book at a young age, and it taught me some of the intricacies of the English language. A dictionary of idioms is interesting because it highlights some of the subtleties of language, metaphorical phrases that have made their way into the American vernacular, some of which are references to outdated cultural customs, like the saying “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.”</p>
								<p>Without a record of the history of these phrases, their meaning and significance could very easily be lost in a post society world. Language is functionally for communication, but with sayings like these idioms, language is elevated to something above communication, and I believe that that is something that we should preserve, just like we preserve texts like Shakespeare’s writings. Language can be beautiful, and it’s these kinds of unnecessary embellishments that make the difference.</p>

						<h3>Poster of Art</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit" class = "item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/art_poster.jpg" alt="" style="height: 512px; width: 375px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>I bought this poster at the Louvre gift shop when I was 10. I held it in hand, carrying the poster through Paris and then later through various airports on the return trip home. I took it out of its casing en route occasionally, against my mother's advice. The poster became nicked and ripped in places, and when I finally got home, I taped it to my wall in two pieces. A year or so later, my mom had it repaired and framed.</p>
								<p>This poster is vital to my survival, not only because of what it has endured, and whatever that symbolizes, but also because of what it depicts. The first and only time I saw The Winged Victory of Samothrace in all her glory was on that fateful day in the Louvre. Our tour guide ushered us into the room; while she explained what we were about to see, I swear I went into some sort of trance. The ceilings were tall, and there she was, in the middle of it all, unbothered by the space hanging above her head and the gawking people below (understandably unbothered, of course–she has faced far worse).  She commanded the room: powerful, beheaded, and strong. I can’t quite remember why I cried, but I did. I cried much harder than a 10-year-old realistically should in an art museum. For the same reason I submit this to the exhibit, I bought the poster. I couldn’t take her home, but I could bring home her picture. And now she stands on my wall, behind her frame, commanding the world and ushering me to do the same. A reminder of the importance of perseverance and strength, even when you’ve lost your head.</p>

						<h3>Blank Page</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>Like most students, I learned how to write on blank sheets of paper. I vividly remember copying letters from a penmanship book onto pieces of reinforced, college-ruled sheets. In elementary school, I bought stacks of patterned notebooks, starting a new one every month or two, when I discovered a new way excuse for filling one up. As I grew, my love of journals has stuck with me, though I don't fill them as recklessly as I did at ten years old.</p>
								<p>To me, blank sheets of paper – whether lined, unlined, graph, college-ruled, bounded, loose-leaf, etc. – represent creativity, possibility, and fearless exploration. They allow us to express our abstract thinking in terms of concrete, visual reality. They remind us of what we deemed important enough to record, five seconds ago or five years ago. Most importantly, they provide us with a space to create and express.</p>
