						<h2>Experience</h2>
						<p>A human life is made up of a collection of experiences. Some of these experiences are so broad that almost everyone can relate to them, creating a universal understanding across society. Some experiences are so specific that only those who were there in the moment together could ever fully understand. These experiences are pursued by us in order to inspire awe, create joy, and further passion. All of these moments, simultaneously individual and universal, are what drive human life.</p>

						<h3>Airplanes</h3>

								<p>Traveling to far away places by plane and being able to see the world below is a remarkable experience. Mostly taken for granted by most, the view seen as an airplane is taking off is a humbling experience for me, letting me see how small humanity is when seen from such far distances. I love being able to see houses, buildings, parks, freeways, bodies of water, mountains, and so much more when flying overhead. Being able to see all these components of our surroundings allows me to appreciate how much of the world exists, and how small a part I play in this great big world.</p>
								<p>In this specific image, I was taking a trip to visit my boyfriend in Portland, Oregon, and I was flying over the San Francisco Bay, my hometown. In certain periods of my life in which those close to me were scattered around the country, and even the world, traveling to visit them meant a great deal to me. My entire family besides my parents and sister live in Brazil, so the only way to visit them is by plane. My reliance on airplanes in order to see those I love is why airplanes are so important in my life.</p>

						<h3>Grand Canyon Postcard</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>I am submitting a postcard to the museum because one of the things I would miss the most is travel. A postcard is a visual memento that depicts a place that someone has traveled to. Today, the ease of transportation makes travel to almost any place possible––cars, buses, trains, boats, and planes allows people to get from point A to point B with almost no hassle. However, entering into a world where civilization has fallen, where gas and electricity are gone and roads crowded with long abandoned cars, it is a journey for people to even travel from one town to the next one over; the idea of travelling across states or countries or oceans is unimaginable to those who were born into the world after the collapse.</p>
								<p>When I travelled to the Grand Canyon this summer, I did a roadtrip with three friends that I have made in college. We are all from very different hometowns, and there is no way any of us would have met if it were not for all of us going to the same university. This trip had really no other purpose than to have fun with friends and to experience new places together. In a world that has collapsed, no one is afforded this kind of luxury.</p>

						<h3>Class Ring</h3>

							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>Gold plated Bellarmine College Preparatory class ring. Sized 10, worn for the two latter years of high school. The blue stone is constant in each ring, symbolizing the cardinal blue colors that represent BCP. The left side is engraved with St. Robert Bellarmine. The right side is marked by the BCP crest, a symbol of the long standing history. BCP, originally founded in 1851 as a part of Santa Clara University, has provided young men with education for over 150 years.</p>
								<p>Symbolism: <br /> Jesuit Education that provided me with a holistic education. This style of education whether at Bellarmine College Prep or Santa Clara University provides students and faculty with an opportunity to grow more than just inside the classroom. Furthermore, the ring signifies my personal bonds between myself and my classmates. A symbol not only of status, but one of ability, to have been educated by a Jesuit institution.</p>

						<h3>Concerts</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>Imagine your favorite band or musician performing for an audience of thousands, or even tens of thousands, of people all singing and dancing along to the music. For me, concerts are mesmerizing experiences, all differing in the types of music being performed, but can include intricate light shows, technological feats of performance design, dancing, and the feeling of singing my at the top of my lungs. Sometimes, when I’m lucky, I can get close enough to the stage and feel the beat of the music pounding in my chest.</p>
								<p>Concerts are a way to experience a macrocosm of what I experience when listening to music on my own. Enjoying music in this form is an expression of myself and my musicality, and they allow me to immerse myself in music. As a musician myself, I often imagine myself up on the stage, like a dream job of sorts. Having performed many times up on stages over the years in small productions, I love going to concerts because it’s an amplified experience of what I feel every time I perform myself. This specific band, Young the Giant, is one of my favorite bands, and I had been listening to their music for years until I got the chance to see them live by chance while living in Seattle for 3 months. It was an unforgettable concert.</p>

							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img class="image-hover" src="images/plane.jpeg" alt="Plane" style="height: 450px; width: 600px;"/></a>
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>Planes offer so much utility. Through planes a person can go anywhere in the world within two days. Trips that would take days by car or train are reduced to a couple hours. The speed of travel planes provide is indispensable. Through planes it’s possible to go see family and friends who are hundreds of miles away. It doesn’t matter if they’re on a different continent and across and ocean, planes can get me there.</p>
								<p>The view from a plane window is amazing. It provides a perspective of the world that is impossible to get any other way. My favorite view from planes are seeing the clouds. For most of the flight, the plane is usually above the clouds meaning I look down on them. Sometimes the clouds are so numerous they form an ocean. Seemingly infinite, the clouds continue for as far as I can see with no sign of world below. But eventually the plane descends through the ocean of clouds. For a time, I can’t see anything until I finally break through. Once beneath the clouds, it looks like the entire world is before me.</p>

						<h3>Travel</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>Airplane tickets are used to prove that travelers have actually paid for a seat on an airplane that will transport people from one place to another. They can also serve as relics, reminder their owners of the places they've been.</p>
								<p>	To be completely honest, this artifact isn't exactly something I'd miss, since I haven't yet bought a plane ticket to another country. Maybe a more precise descriptor would be the hope of someday going somewhere new. I hope to travel everywhere, to see everything before it's too late. I want to try different foods, wrestle with the difficulties of living somewhere where no one speaks my language, learn about different cultures and ways of life. Without air travel, this dream is completely impossible.</p>
								<p>I think Mandel recognizes this difficulty, which is why she ends her book by writing "Perhaps vessels are setting out even now... driven by need or perhaps simply by curiosity: whatever became of the countries on the other side?" The most frightening aspect of the "end of civilization" is that different parts of the world become unconnected, that human beings no longer have a sense of "species thinking." By ending the novel by suggesting that sea travel might be restarting, Mandel reassures her readers that not all hope is lost.</p>
