						<h2>Utility</h2>
						<p>So much of human life is dependent upon routine and comfort and efficiency, and we have created objects that allow us to fulfill these tasks and needs. There are so many objects that humans rely on as a part of their life that may oftentimes be forgotten or taken for granted. However, in a world unable to manufacture the objects we depend on every day, we would quickly notice their absence — even if we did not fully appreciate their presence in our current world.</p>

						<h3>Lip Balm</h3>
						<div class="items">

							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>Pictured here is a small, yellow capsule that holds lip balm. Lip balm’s purpose is to provide an occlusive layer to the lip’s surface and seal moisture and protect from outside exposure. It is often made of materials like waxes and petroleum jelly that are intended to prevent lip dryness and maintain comfort. The Carmex lip balm pictured here can be applied using a finger, though lip balm comes in various forms and brands. Other popular lip balm brands include ChapStick, Burt’s Bees, Lip Smacker, EOS, Lypsol, and Blistex. Many of the lip balms created by these brands can be applied directly to the lips, and often they come in various scents, flavors, and colors as well.</p>
								<p>I self identify as a lip-balm “addict”. I have lip balm in my backpack, desk drawer, and dresser drawer. It is one of those items I never fail to grab before leaving my dorm, and I apply it frequently throughout the day. Some argue that lip balm can actually lead to dryer lips overtime. Regardless, it still provides me instant satisfaction and I doubt I’ll be quitting any time soon.</p>

						<h3>Central Air System</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>A central air system regulates the temperature of the air indoors. It runs through a heater if the air needs to be warmed and if it needs to be cooled, it runs through an air conditioner. In the heating and cooling process, it runs through filters that catch all the pollutants in the air like dust and mold. People are able to control the temperature of the air by setting the thermostat to the temperature they want, and the system would do the rest.</p>
								<p>I grew up in Fresno, CA, and during the summer months temperatures reach over 100 degrees for months on end. In the winter, at night it gets below freezing. It was nice to catch a break from extreme temperatures during the spring and fall, however, unfortunately the pollen in the air drove  my allergies wild. The central air system in my house regulated these extreme temperatures and made the indoors comfortable. The regulated temperature was essential to me falling asleep. Without a central air system, temperatures would be unbearable in a large number of places. There would no longer be the great feeling of relief from walking through the front door into your perfect indoor climate. There would no longer be air filters that clean the air that you breathe removing the pollutants and allergens in the air. I couldn't imagine a world without this luxury.</p>

						<h3>Alarm Clock</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/alarm-clock.jpg" alt="Alarm clock" style="height: 475px; width: 450px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>An alarm clock had a few simple functions: to tell time and to make a loud beeping sound to wake people up in the morning. The alarms were often customizable and could sound out various tones or songs.</p>
								<p>Rarely a day goes by when I don’t set an alarm. It doesn’t matter if I’m on winter break, or a weekend, or on vacation-- I will set an alarm. Time is something I pay a lot of attention to. When I set my alarm right before I go to bed, I know how much sleep I’ll be getting and I can plan my morning accordingly. I typically work better in the morning and have better focus, so it is important for me to maximize my morning productivity. Setting an alarm is such a habit for me that I would consider it to be part of my nightly routine. Even though I keep a consistent wake up time during the week, I always double check that the alarm is properly set before I fall asleep. With the collapse of civilization, I would miss the importance of using time to organize my everyday life.</p>
