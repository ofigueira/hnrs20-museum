						<h2>Passion</h2>
						<p>Every person has things that interest them, things that they are passionate about. These things define us by influencing our ideologies, career choices, and personal goals. They bring us unbridled joy. They relax us when we are feeling stressed. In a world where survival is the only focus, things like passions would be the first to go. But it is interests and passions that bring so much variety and happiness into our lives. Without these things, we would be but shells of people.</p>

						<h3>Deck of Cards</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/deck-of-cards.jpg" alt="Deck of cards" style="height: 400px; width: 550px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>This artifact is a deck of cards which are used to pass the time, have fun with others, or even pull off magic tricks. Survival would be a bit more fun if you were able to bring a deck of cards along with you. There are many different games you can play, or you can even come up with your own. You can play with a large group or by yourself. Not only would the games be fun, but they allow you to forget your troubles for a bit and just enjoy playing a simple game. The options are endless, and it would also allow people to express their creativity by coming up with new games or fun ways to use the cards.</p>
								<p>Cards can also be used for magic tricks. Growing up, seeing something supposedly impossible happen right before your eyes was exciting for me, and it could inspire hope in the kids growing up in the future. Cards also represent randomness because you never know what card you could draw. To me, this shows how sometimes things happen that are out of our control, and you just need to do your best with the hand you were dealt. There are many life lessons to learn and lots of fun to have with a deck of cards.</p>

						<h3>PS4</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is an interactive gaming system that projects video games onto a tv. The games are navigated using a controller where different buttons represent different movements. Each game is unique and has different actions the controller can make. In addition to the games, the system had many different applications, such as Netflix, which allows you to stream movies to the tv.</p>
								<p>Ever since I was a little kid, I have owned a gaming system. Gaming systems offer me a chance to escape from reality. The system transports me into a different universe universe where I can soar through the city like Spiderman or imagine I’m in the trenches during WW2 playing Call of Duty. When I power on the system any prior worries I had melt away. The PS4 is not just for having fun, the consul helps me connect with a community of gamers. Most of the games I play are all multiplayer, which allows me to interact with people across the globe in the game. The PS4 presents me access to friend groups who I would normally never get the chance to interact with.</p>

						<h3>Amusement Parks</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/theme-parks.jpeg" alt="Theme park" style="height: 425px; width: 525px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>These are some of the happiest places on earth, just as Disneyland, a world renowned theme park, famously advertises. People travel far and wide to go on thrilling adventures, see their imagination personified and manifested in the form of rides and shows, and escape reality for a period of time. Amusement and theme parks exist for our amusement; they are the epitome of thriving. One enters an amusement park and is simply engrossed in all that it has to offer: rides, food, musical performances, meeting characters from popular movies and shows, and extensive themed merchandise to buy and bring home to remember one’s experience forever. It seems that all worries are left behind at their gates, and amusement parks are popular around the world.</p>
								<p>I have always loved Disneyland, and in this image, I was at the park with my family over New Year’s Eve one year. I love Disneyland so much that I went once every year for five years in a row when I was younger. It’s always a happy experience to visit the park, and I have so many memories from every trip I have been on. I always forget all my worries as soon as I enter, and I’ll never forget the experiences I’ve had with all the different people that have accompanied me.</p>

						<h3>Trampoline</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>There is nothing quite like the trampoline. It is a fixture in many a yard, the pinnacle of outdoor entertainment for all ages, bringing families, friends, and neighbors together. Not only is it an excellent excuse to spend time outdoors and exercise, but the flying sensation created by a good, proper bounce is also unparalleled. And what about the camaraderie forged in a simple game of Crack the Egg? The late-night stargazing (if your trampoline is so adequately positioned to view the sky)? The open-air slumber parties that have you lugging sleeping bags onto the trampoline, only to groggily lug them back inside hours later on account of an early morning thunderstorm?</p>
								<p>It is memories like these–and of course, that lovely, heart-pounding, flying feeling– that makes the trampoline an integral part of my life and the lives of many others. My trampoline at home sits right outside my bedroom window. It is rarely used anymore; my sisters and I have been too caught up in merely surviving the throes of teenageness to remember the joy of jumping. It was covered in leaves until just the other morning. I brushed them away and pushed off into the air. I felt alive. I felt free. And then I fell. But like that bogus old adage, I got up again. And again. And again. Each time I went higher. As my sisters woke up, they came to join me. We jumped, together, for the first time in probably three years. It was awesome, for lack of a more fitting adjective. It’s a trampoline, for god’s sake, but this thing, I swear, is magic.</p>

						<h3>Yoga Mat</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/yoga-mat.jpg" alt="Yoga mat" style="height: 425px; width: 500px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>Yoga was a form of physical and mental exercise, practiced for thousands of years around the world. Western yoga practices often entailed a membership at a yoga studio with roughly one hour exercise classes.</p>
								<p>I’ve been practicing yoga on and off for about 5 years. Yoga is something that has brought me a lot of happiness, mental clarity, and strength-- all of which has taken place on my yoga mat. Whether I’m doing yoga in a studio, my bedroom, or outside, I rely on my yoga mat to connect me to the ground. With the end of civilization, the yoga classes I’ve taken in a studio or through online videos would become obsolete. Although I could still use my mat, my yoga practice is reliant on some form of teacher instruction. Without yoga classes, I would be unable to continue my yoga practice in the way that I have over the past 5 years. It’s hard to imagine a post-civilization society where yoga is as accessible as it is now. After all, it’s hard to clear your head on a yoga mat when you have to carry a knife.</p>

						<h3>Starbucks Rewards Card</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>One of the biggest coffeehouse chains worldwide was called Starbucks. They offered a rewards program for regular customers to gain rewards after collecting a certain number of points.</p>
								<p>I wouldn’t say I’m obsessed with Starbucks, but I have ordered drinks there regularly for a long time. My current go-to drinks are the Pink drink (if it’s hot out) or a soy milk latte with vanilla (when it’s cold).  In 2017, I made enough purchases to maintain Gold Status, which means I get rewards more often. I’ve maintained Gold Status each year since then. My favorite part about Starbucks is how reliable it is; no matter where I am, there’s surely a Starbucks nearby. As a result, there is also an element of simplicity because I know exactly what’s on the menu when I go to order and can even plan ahead by ordering on the mobile app. When I get enough points to redeem for a free drink, it truly makes my day. The Gold Rewards Member status gives me something to look forward to because every purchase gets me closer to that free drink.</p>

						<h3>Dive Watch</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<a class="image fit item-image-left item-images"><img src="images/watch.JPG" alt="Dive watch" style="height: 500px; width: 500px;"/></a>
							<!-- item descriptions, 1 "p" per paragraph -->
							<div class="item-description-right">
								<p>Wristwatches are personal, wearable timekeeping devices. This one is for SCUBA diving, so it is waterproof and pressure resistant.</p>
								<p>This watch is a family heirloom that was passed down to me by my father. It was my 18th birthday present, and it is very significant to me. It’s a good watch, but most of its value is because of family history, and the connection to my dad. It’s a dive watch, and scuba diving is something that my dad and I really bonded over when I was younger. This watch represents the idea of legacy, which is an important aspect of conserving the past, and human nature in general.</p>
								<p>The watch itself also represents the technological ability of advanced civilization. Timekeeping is one of the most rudimentary aspects of civilization, dating all the way back to the sundial. The wristwatch is an impressive evolution of that. The tiny, and perfectly machined gears that make the watch tick require extreme amounts of detail, and precision, and are a testament to how technologically advanced humans have become.</p>

						<h3>Jersey</h3>
						<div class="items">
							<div class="item-description-left">
								<p>A dark red stain can been seen on the inside. Because the jersey has been passed down year after year, it is especially worn. The jersey is adult size 58, and made of nylon and polyester. The Santa Clara crest is centered on the front of the jersey, and #23 is stitched upon the back.</p>
								<p>The SCU Ice Hockey jersey is my symbol for the memories and friendships created through team sports. Worn every game, the jersey has seen multiple years of use, and can be seens as the connection between generations of players all playing for the same thing: the crest on the front of the jersey. Brought together by a common goal of playing collegiate ice hockey, we unite under the crest of Santa Clara University.</p>
